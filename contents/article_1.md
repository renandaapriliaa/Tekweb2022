### _Why is taking photos every day so important? originally appeared on Quora: the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world._


## **Take photos for the sake of recording memories.**

In capturing moments of importance and beauty, photography helps people revisit memories in a way otherwise not possible. Simply put, photography grants people the ability to immortalize moments in time.

But here’s the thing: it also helps us stay connected with our loved ones. In this way, photography proves more than just art–it’s a modicum of teleportation.

It’s an amazing thing that we’re able to so easily document the more remarkable moments of our life like this. It’s a gift to our aunts and grandparents and siblings–those who might otherwise feel detached from our lives–and it’s nourishing for the self, as well. Getting into the practice of capturing your life is good for your mental health.

A lot of us tend to dwell on the more negative things that happen to us. We go on a beautiful vacation and see great sites, eat marvelous food, and interact with history, but on our flight back, we fixate on the hotel employee who was rude to us in the lobby on our last day. This is a propensity almost all of us have—this fixation on the negative.

## **Take photos to improve your photography skills.**

Of course, in addition to providing genuine joy and happiness to both ourselves and the people we love, photography is a craft, and practicing it every day will only help you improve.

We think of photography as a craft practiced only by everyday amateurs with smartphones or actual professionals with a certain amount of knowledge. But the truth is, anyone can become a great photographer with a bit of practice. In fact, practice beats talent every time.

It follows, then, that when you take photos every day, you improve in a seriously meaningful way. You might not even be trying to improve, but you do. If you do anything on a regular basis and work on your process and analyze the results, you will improve.

Don’t believe me? Start taking pictures for one full year. You might not even realize it, but when you look back, you’ll notice how your skills have been growing. That’s a rewarding experience in and of itself–and one we all have the ability to partake in.

## **Take photos to embrace and improve your inner creativity.**

The power of photography as art is that it serves to enhance the way we see the world.

Try taking a photo of the same object every day. What you’ll find is, by spending time studying this object–a person, or a building, or a budding tree–you’ll find new looks, styles, and angles that accentuate it in different, more interesting ways.

This kind of practice has a way of activating your brain and stimulating your inner creativity that makes life more interesting.

Personally, by practicing the art of photography every day, I’ve come to see the world differently. It’s also changed my perception of what in life is important and worthwhile. There is beauty in the little things.

Another thing you’ll learn by familiarizing yourself with photography as art is that it’s not about what you capture in an image, so much as what sort of emotion your images reveal and evoke.
